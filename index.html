                        <p>
                            Starting from ground zero, we'll introduce you to the various ways cryptocurrency can be purchased, including exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken, ATM machines, and more, and discuss the pros and cons of each approach.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Crypto Exchanges</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you elect to signup with an exchange (as most do), we'll walk you through the process of becoming verified and linking up your bank account for transferring dollars to and from the exchange.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you're not interested in signing up for an exchange that requires ID verification and linking a bank account, that's perfectly ok! You can still use certain exchanges for trading assets, and we'll happily show you how it's done.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Crypto Wallets</h3>
                        <p>
                            Finally, we'll introduce you to various types of cryptocurrency wallets, putting you 100% in charge of your assets! Being your own custodian is critically important, negating all of the risk involved with leaving your assets on an exchange (leading to the horror stories you hear of people losing their assets due to collapses and scams).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Typically, all of this can be accomplished in 1 session lasting roughly 4-5 hours, but could go longer depending on your level of comfort and whether you want to explore cryptocurrencies more in depth (such as why there are so many and what the differences are between them).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Note also that the verification process on exchanges can take hours or sometimes days, so transferring all of your assets to your wallet(s) purchased during our session may not be possible. However, you'll be well versed at this point and know exactly what to do. If you're still uncomfortable making the transfers yourself, we can always meet for a quick follow-up session.
                        </p>
